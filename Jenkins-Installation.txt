tep 1?—?Installing Jenkins
======
First, we’ll add the repository key to the system, run the below command from your terminal

* sudo wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins-ci.org.key | sudo apt-key add -

When the key is added, the system will return OK.


Next, we’ll append the Debian package repository address to the server’s sources.list:

* echo "deb http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/debian binary/" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list

Let’s run a system update:

* sudo apt-get update

Now let’s install Jenkins:

* sudo apt-get install jenkins -y


Step 2?—?Starting the Jenkins Server
======
* sudo systemctl start jenkins

Lets verify that Jenkins has started successfully with the below command:

* sudo systemctl status jenkins

If all went well, the output will show that the service is Active.


Step 3?—?Configuring the Firewall Settings
======

Jenkins runs on port 8080 by default, lets allow access to the port

$ sudo ufw allow 8080

Check the status of the command we ran above

$ sudo ufw status

If you receive an inactive status after running the above command, run the below command to fix it

$ sudo ufw enable

Again Check the status of the command we ran above

$ sudo ufw status


Step 4?—?Setting up Jenkins
======

Because our Jenkins server is on AWS we will need to expose port :8080 in our security group

Lets jump back into the EC2 console view, select Security Groups from the left side scroll bar

And choose Create Security Group
Security group name: xxxxxxxxxxxx
Descriptiion: xxxxxxxxxxx
vpc : xxxxxxx

Inbound :-

SSH - 22
CUSTOM TCP - 8080
Return to the EC2 console and change your VM’s security group to the newly created Security Group

Select Launch Instance : 
Actions->Networking -> Change Security Groups:

Uncheck the old security group (default) and select the newly created one

Reconnect the Ec2 machine.

we’ll visit Jenkins on its default port, 8080, using the server IP address: 

* - http://ip_address:8080

The IP address of your VM can be found in the EC2 console page

Jump back into your terminal session and run the below command for the initial password
* $ sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword

Copy the password from your terminal and paste that password into the password field in your web browser

Select Continue

When the installation is complete, you’ll be prompted to set up the first admin user. Go ahead and create the Admin user.

Select Save and Finish


Jenkins has been successfully installed!!
